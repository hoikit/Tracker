This directory contains the SQLite database file for the Game Time Tracker application.

The application automatically saves your game session data to the SQLite database when you end a timer session.
The default database filename is "game-time-tracker.db".

The database is automatically accessed when the application starts, so your data will persist between sessions.

Note: SQLite database files (*.db) are excluded from git version control in the .gitignore file.
